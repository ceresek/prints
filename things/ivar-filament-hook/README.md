# About

Hooks and spool guide to hold large filament spools.
Fits the Ikea IVAR corner stands. Several heights
included but really the highest one is needed
to safely hold large spools.

Different versions cater to slightly different hole locations on the stands.

# Printing

Printed with PETG and a lot (8 ?) of perimeters for strength.
The spool guide may wobble at high print speeds,
surprisingly the print seems fine afterwards.

# Copying

Model CC-BY ceres@tmatmouci.cz.
Using SolidPython and OpenSCAD.
