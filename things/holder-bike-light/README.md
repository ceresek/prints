# About

A holder to attach the Smart 321 bike light to standard luggage carrier.
Holes for two M4 screws spaced 52 mm apart, can be edited in sources.

# Printing

Printed with PETG and supports, no special attention required.
Used more perimeters for extra toughness but not sure if that
is even necessary as the light is quite light :-)

# Copying

Model CC-BY ceres@tmatmouci.cz.
Using FreeCAD.
