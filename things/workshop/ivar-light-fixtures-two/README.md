# About

A set of fittings to attach a 16mm angled LED light profile to the Ikea IVAR shelf system, plus boxes for the wiring.

Tailor made for components purchased from http://www.ledsolution.cz:

- aluminium profile http://eshop.ledsolution.cz/hlinikovy-profil-pro-led-pasky-rohovy-r5

# Printing

Printed with PETG for thermal resistance.
Needs supports, use support enforcers
to get rid of supports inside the
cable tunnel.

There seem to be multiple slightly different versions of the Ikea IVAR shelf system.
Please edit the sources if you find the holder pins too tight or too loose.
