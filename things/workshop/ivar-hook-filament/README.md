# About

Hooks and spool guide to hold large filament spools,
Fits the Ikea IVAR corner stands. Several heights
included but really the highest one is needed
to safely hold large spools.

Different versions cater to slightly different hole locations on the stands.
To figure out which version fits, print the first 3 mm of the model and try
the fit on the stand, the wrap around part should fit without bending.

# Printing

Hooks printed in PETG with 0.2 mm layers and 7 perimeters for strength, organic supports needed for the pins.

The spool guide may wobble at high print speeds,
surprisingly the print seems fine afterwards.

# Copying

Model CC-BY ceres@tmatmouci.cz.
Using SolidPython and OpenSCAD.
