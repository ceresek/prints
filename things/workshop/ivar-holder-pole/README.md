# About

A short holder for 28 mm diameter pole in two slightly different diameters.
The wrap thread is conical and will grab the pole when screwed onto the ring.

# Printing

Prototype holder printed in PETG with variable layer height and 3 perimeters to make sure the wrap thread is not hollow.

Prototype support tube printed in PLA with variable layer height and random scarf seam to avoid tearing alongside seams.
