# About

A box to store external power plug in, with wall mount holes.
Intended to shield the power plug from sun and most rain,
but not water proof.

# Printing

A sample printed with PLA sags when loaded in direct sunlight,
but since the whole box is intended as a temporary solution,
this was not a problem. UV resistant material would be
needed for serious use.
