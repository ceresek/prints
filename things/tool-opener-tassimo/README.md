# About

A tool to help take apart Tassimo capsules for recycling (and maybe getting that last bit of the chocolate powder out too :-).
Just push the two concentric rings into the hole in the center of the capsule and rotate the arm to cut off the foil lid.
Use the other end of the tool to scrape out the coffee dregs.

# Printing

Prototype printed in PLA with variable layer height to get more accuracy on the edgy parts,
0.2 mm base layer, 2 perimeters, 0.8 mm solid layers, 25% gyroid infill.
This seems to be sturdy enough for repeated use.

The exact dimensions of the center rings depend on the printer tolerance,
hence models with slightly different gap sizes are included. A gap size
of 5 or 6 seems to be a good start, move towards larger gaps if the
tool seems too tight and vice versa.
