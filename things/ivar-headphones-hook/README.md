# About

A headphones holder for the Ikea IVAR system.
Different versions cater to slightly different hole locations on the stands.
To figure out which version fits, print the first 3 mm of the model and try
the fit on the stand, the wrap around part should fit without bending.

Snapping the full print onto the stand requires some strength,
insert the pins into the holes first while bending the hook.

# Printing

Printed in PETG with 0.2 mm layers and 6 perimeters, organic supports needed for the pins.

# Copying

Model CC-BY ceres@tmatmouci.cz.
Using SolidPython and OpenSCAD.
