# About

A pad that the Fenix HM85R-T V2.0 headlamp can be clipped on.
The idea is to sew the pad onto a baseball cap and then
attach the headlamp without the belt.

# Printing

Printed standing on the edge with the three square protrusions,
adhesion does not seem to be a problem, supports for the side
clips but not for the hexagonal holes. I used PETG for the
prototypes.
