# About

A tall jar for dog biscuits with slotted bottom for crumbs.
We keep dog biscuits in cylindrical jars but over time
a mess of crumbs accumulates on the bottom. This jar
has a double bottom with a screw-on lid that holds
the crumbs.

# Printing

Two versions of the jar are included, one with round holes and one with slits.
The one with round holes turned out to be too difficult to print on my printer,
the complex first layer pattern was prone to creating lift off artifacts that
spoiled the print. The version with slits is easier on the printer.

The prototype was printed in PLA with 0.2 mm layer height, 3 perimeters
and a fuzzy skin with thickness 0.1 mm starting above the outer thread,
for a surface that is easier to grasp. The threads on the jar and the
lid are somewhat tricky to align though, perhaps exchanging an even
look of the fuzzy skin for a finer layer height on the threads
would work better.

The thread dimensions and tolerance can be tuned in the sources.

Remember to use random seam position to avoid visible pattern on the jar.
