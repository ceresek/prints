# About

An insert for using longer screw with Thule FreeRide roof top bike rack.
The rack cannot hold bikes with wide frames such as e-bikes. The insert
makes it possible to replace the T shaped screw with a longer M8 screw
to hold a slightly wider frame (up to around 10 centimeters).

# Printing

Printed with PETG and five or so perimeters for increased strength.
Needs support for the screw head pocket but otherwise prints fine.

# Copying

Model CC-BY ceres@tmatmouci.cz.
Using FreeCAD.
