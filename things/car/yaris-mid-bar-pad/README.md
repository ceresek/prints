# About

A flat cover for the center console of Yaris NG Hybrid (tested with 2023 model, might fit other).
Our dog enjoys squatting on the center console but sometimes presses the various buttons located
there. The cover hides the buttons and makes the surface flat so a bit more comfortable
(I hope) for the dog.
