# About

A stand to raise the Eizo FlexScan series monitor (233mm round base) to eye level.

# Printing

Prototype printed with PETG for thermal stability, 1mm top and bottom shells,
20% adaptive cubic infill, 3 perimeters, this is probably overkill though.
Dimensions can be adjusted in the source files, or just drop me a message
with specific height and diameter.

# Patches

The slicer shape should be rectangular (T shaped rather than V shaped) to avoid wobble along Y axis.
