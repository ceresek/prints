# About

A boring battery stand made to test the idea of a velcro style pattern.
The patterns on the side of the stand fit each other, making it
possible to connect multiple stands together into larger
compositions.

# Printing

Printed with PLA with no supports.

The pattern dimensions were tested on a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.2 mm layers,
the result is quite likely also sensitive to the various tolerances of
the particular printer. If too much force is needed to make the stands
fit, try to wear the pattern down a little by fitting shorter segments
first. The source files offer multiple tunable parameters too,
