# About

Simple damper pads for a horizontal bar construction I own.

# Printing

Printed sideways in FLEX with solid infill. Some observations:

- The tube shape will get slightly deformed near the top,
  most likely owing to the bridge strings pulling the
  thin walls together.

    - Perhaps a design with ribs on the thin walls would be more resistant to this.
    - Setting seam position to random may have helped a bit too.

- Careful with bridging settings in the slicer, some
  choose wrong bridging direction (along rather than across).

- Solid infill seems to work best with concentric settings.
