# About

An adapter for connecting vaccum hose to hand held Dyson vacuum.
Assumes hose with 43 mm outer diameter and counter clock wise
thread with 6 mm pitch. No idea if this is in any way
standard, it was just the hose I had :-) the thread
dimensions and profile are editable in the source.

# Printing

The prototype was printed in PETG with 0.15 mm layers and 3 perimeters,
variable layer height, probably less important was the 33% gyroid infill.

The part that goes into the Dyson vacuum should be printed with the wider
side up, automated supports except for the space inside the tube where
the button sinks in. Use brim.

The part that goes into the vacuum hose should be printed with the thread
side up, automated supports on the build plate. Use brim.

Be careful when connecting the two parts, the plastic catch bits break
off easily along layers. Perhaps reducing the print fan or increasing
the printing temperature somewhat for those bits would help.
