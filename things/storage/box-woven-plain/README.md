# About

A plain rattan style box.
Python sources include parametrization.

# Printing

Several earlier prototypes were printed using PLA with variable layer height settings,
either 0.15 mm or 0.2 mm base layer height, and either 2 or 3 perimeters. The current
variant should align with 0.2 mm constant layer height instead.

Ignore the print stability warning and do not use supports.
