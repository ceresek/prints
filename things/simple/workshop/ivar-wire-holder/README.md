# About

A simple cable hook that fits into the side
stand of the Ikea IVAR shelf system. Three
versions with different gap sizes are
provided.

To install, just insert the two L shaped guides
into the stand holes and then slide the hook
body onto that.

# Printing

Prototype printed in PETG with 3 perimeters and
0.2 mm layer height, an earlier version with 2
perimeters was a bit too easy to bend (but
probably would work fine too).
