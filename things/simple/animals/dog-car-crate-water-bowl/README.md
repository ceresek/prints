# About

A water bowl with a lid to be attached inside a car crate.
The lid has a splash shield on the inside to reduce spills.
The hooks attach to the crate walls made of horizontal bars.

# Printing

Prototype printed in PETG with 0.2 mm layers, designed for 0.4 mm nozzle.
The bowl and the hooks use 8 perimeters to avoid weaker infill around
the hook attachment rail, the lid can do fine with 3 perimeters.

The bowl may need brim to avoid warping on corners.

The dimensions should be easy to adjust in the sources.
