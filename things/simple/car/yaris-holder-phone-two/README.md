# About

A simple pad to place a cell phone on, fits into the small compartment left of the steering wheel on Toyota Yaris 2010.
Update from the previous design, with the clip slightly stronger and the two halves fitting together without glue.

# Printing

Printed with PETG for thermal stability, needs supports but prints mostly fine.
After carefully cleaning away the support bits, just press the two parts together.

# Copying
