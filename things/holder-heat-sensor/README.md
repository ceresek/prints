The 13 mm accumulator holder is closer to the ideal model.
It should be about 10 mm shorter, the outer part should
be about 1 or 1.5 mm thicker.

The M12 boiler holder is closer to the ideal model.
It should be about 20 mm shorter, the thread part
should be only about 10 mm, the radius is fine
but the thread pitch is possibly wrong.
