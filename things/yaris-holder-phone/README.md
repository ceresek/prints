# About

A simple pad to place a cell phone on, fits into the small compartment left of the steering wheel on Toyota Yaris 2010.

# Printing

Printed with PETG for thermal stability, the two halves are glued together with epoxy.
The bottom part needs support around the clip, the top part works better with support
around sides. Avoid support in the connecting groove.
